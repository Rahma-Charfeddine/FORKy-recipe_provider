# FORKy-recipe_provider
My final Project for the IT-325 Web Services course  consists of a RESTful API named “FORKy” developed using Node.js, Express, JWT.
The resources were stored thanks to the implementation of MongoDB. I have also used technologies such as Postman, VSCode, and Git.
This project contains all the CRUD Operations, secured with JWT token authentication.
The project’s function is returning a desired recipe to the user based on the ingredients that he/she already has.
